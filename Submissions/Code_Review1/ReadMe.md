# Gillian's Hmwk #7
## **Hello Jacob!**  
I hope you found my code wildly impressive (just kidding, I am still a newbie at this, but pretty proud of what I'm pulling off so far!)

### Instructions for submitting my forecast:

  - Run code block at top of file to import modules and define functions.  

  - For Task 1:
    - Run through each block of "Run Cell" sections in sequence.   No output need be noted for forecasting yet, though I do print the dataframes to see the table format.

  - For Task 2 and Task 3:
    - Run through each block of "Run Cell" sections in sequence and marvel at my amazing AR model r2 value!  And then chuckle when you see how little data I am using to get that value trained!

  - For Task 4:
    - Run first code block (AR Model) and note the values output from the AR model for "AR-1WK" and "AR-2WK".  Input those values into Table 2 below.  
    - The next two blocks in "Jill's Code" section print the historical minimum flow for the week and the statistics for the last 7 days.  I use these as discussion points in my markdown -  they are not needed by you as input for this assignment (based on instructions that you only need to pull the 4 final values and review via the rubric).
