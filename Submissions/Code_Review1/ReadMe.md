# Gillian's Hmwk #7
## **Hello Jacob!**  
I hope you found my code wildly impressive (just kidding, I am still a newbie at this, but pretty proud of what I'm pulling off so far!)

### Instructions for submitting my forecast:

  - Run code block at top of file to import modules and define functions.  

  - For Task 1:

    - Run through each block of "Run Cell" sections in sequence.   No output need be noted for forecasting yet, though I do print the dataframes to see the table format.
    - I just realized that I have not been hardcoding my file location and might not know how to do it to make sure it will work for you.   This may be the one thing you might have to modify.  I hope not, but just be aware.  Not sure how to test it to make sure.


  - For Task 2 and Task 3:

    - Run through each block of "Run Cell" sections in sequence and marvel at my amazing AR model r2 value!  And then chuckle when you see how little data I am using to get that value trained!  


  - For Task 4: Note the key info to pull out and enter into the tables below:

    - Run first code block (AR Model) and note the values output from the AR model for "AR-1WK" and "AR-2WK".  Input those values into Table 2 below.  
    - The next two blocks in "Jill's Code" section print the historical minimum flow for the week and the statistics tables for the last 7 days.  I use these as discussion points in my markdown -  they are not needed by you as input for this assignment (based on instructions that you only need to pull the 4 final values and review via the rubric).
    - The next cell block plots a simple visual look at two-week flow trend.
    - Next few blocks get into finding the mean for the week and the percent change for flow values.   I already entered in the variables that needed manual entry based on output. The block with the if statement will return the value for my 1 week forecast  [JILL-1WK].
    - This code then repeats itself using the two-week data.  The final if statement code block will output the two-week flow forecast value  [JILL-2WK].  
    - Enter these values into table 1 below and that's it!
