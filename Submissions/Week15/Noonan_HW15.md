3/3 - Great job! I'm really glad you experimented with Cyverse a bit. That one takes more time to setup for sure but can be very powerful depending on what you want to do.

### Week 15 Questions
---
*1) What resources did you request on Ocelote? How long did you wait in the queue for your job to run and how long did it take to run?*
  - I used the suggested resource request of 1 node, 1 core.  It ran nearly instantly (gave me a job number and spit out two output files "e" and "o" plus job number).  However, the "e" output contains an error that shows the run was not successful, and the "o" file is blank.  I tried a bunch of troubleshooting with no success.  After office hours, I was able to fix and run the .pbs and get an output.  Thanks

*2) What was the most confusing part to you about setting up and running your job on Ocelote?*
 - Everything was going smoothly until i tried to run and get an output.  It would be nice to have more detailed error message to help debug the issue.   Also, when i typed "vi" in terminal as per your notes to "look at the outputs of your job" I wasn't sure what to enter after that to look at them.  That part was not clear so I just exited via the :q-Enter command.

*3) Where else did you run your job? How did the setup compare to your run on Ocelote?*
  - The second resource that I chose was Cyverse, primarily since i was already planning to look into this for a data-heavy research project for work, that also would like to be able to share the data with others so based on your description, this would be preferential to the HPC for that reason.  And i was encouraged by your description of them being very user-centric and happy to help.  So, I signed up for a Cyverse account, logged in and uploaded files.  I made a Jupyter notebook for my HW15 python code.  I requested access to Atmosphere and was granted instantly though it says it could take 24 hours.  I created a new project.  I added Ubuntu 18.04 JupyterHub Image and launched a new instance.  I waited and then it's status became active.  I copied the IP address for the instance and typed "ssh genoonan@128.196.142.10" into terminal.  I then got an email saying my "Atmosphere instance is available".  Then i realized i think next I need to download iCommands.  Now it is late and I need to go to sleep.   I will pick back up in the morning if there is time, but likely not since i have 8AM work meeting.       

  So that's as far as i got.  Basically - i really just need some time to actually learn how to use this tool...... :P  

  Time ran out for trying to figure it out, but I intend to continue this investigation (homework or no homework) to actually hopefully use in future professional and research life......this will likely include doing the video tutorial and how-to guides in more detail when time allows.

*4) What questions do you still have after doing this?*
  - Still a little unclear on difference between virtual machine images, containers, dockers, binders.  Though i get the concept of what and why to have this type of environment.  I think some may be "brands" of the general term, like dockers?  are they containers?  or VM images?  or are they all pretty much the same thing??
