*1)A brief summary of the how you chose to generate your forecast this week.*
- Seeing as how I have not been using my AR model all along I decided to remove it from the equation this week so as to simplify my learning base for the new topics.  I have a finite amount of time each week to spend coding and this week I primarily used that time towards reading through API and json introductory materials and training, playing with acquiring data from Mesonet and Daymet and seeing what i could do with it.  I was able to sign up for Mesonet and obtain data using their API and URL string for different "vars".  As well, I experimented with code in the training materials for acquiring info on nearby stations within an "x" mile radius of a lat/long point.  I was surprised to see that the starter code "stids" QVDA3 was not in the list(?).  I went through the starter code and looked at keys and types and tried to pull out data and that is where it got a bit challenging with the Mesonet dataset.  In the end, I think I did max out my token since I was getting HTTP 404 request errors or something of the sort.  Seeing as I was successful in downloading precip data from Daymet with no issues and seemed much more simplified dataset, I decided to move forward with that given the available time frame for work. I forecasted my model this week using what I have deemed "Jill's code".    

*2) A description of the dataset you added*  

 *-What is the dataset?*

*-Why did you choose it?*

*-What location have you chosen?*

*-Where did you get the data from?*

*-What was your approach to accessing it?*

*3) A plot of your additional time series along with your streamflow time series.*
