**Week 2 Forecast Rationale**
For Week 2, i decided to use more short term data instead of my previous historical averaging going back through 1989.   I figure with global climate changes considered, the short term trend might be more accurate.   For next week i used the average of the past 7 days.   For the next two weeks i went back to 2019 and used the average of that similar time window data.  For the seasonal, i changed the forcecase values from a historical average to a 7-day average for 2019. Tada!
